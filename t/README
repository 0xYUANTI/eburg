Overview
========
Test cases are grouped by source, with those in eburg/ being largely original
(some have been taken from the literature). Each test case comprises at least
two files: testcase.brl which is the eburg specification and testcase.out
which is the expected result of calling testcase:main().

The other directories generally contain at least two additional files per
testcase: The original input specification and the code generator generated by
the respective BURG system (e.g. mlburg/example2.sml is the result of
$ ml-burg example2.burg). These are intended for manual inspection.
The licenses of these files are indicated below.
