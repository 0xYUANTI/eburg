This is a variant of the burg grammar for Gforth created for a newer
version of Gforth.

You also find the file brew-sequences that contains the basic blocks
present in Gforth with the brew benchmark.  Using these sequences with
the grammar: The leftmost operator is the root, the rightmost operator
is the immediate parent of the leaf, and the leaf is s0.  Ignore empty
basic blocks.

These sequences were generated with a Gforth compiled with
-DBURG_FORMAT and the following command:

gforth --print-sequences -e "warnings off create startup-bench" ~/forth-bench/brew-transit_38/brew.fs 2>brew-sequences

- anton
